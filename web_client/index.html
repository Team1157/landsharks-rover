<h1>Sandshark</h1>
<p>Sandshark is a remote-controlled solar-powered rover designed and built by four members of the Boulder High School Robotics Club: Noah Mollerstuen, Gary Bailey, Mikeal Steinman, and Amitan Bar-Evan. It began as a summer project, but it took more than two years and hundreds of hours to complete. Thank you to Boulder High School and the Jim and Dede Bartlett Foundation for supporting this project. Thanking you to Ashton Johnston and the Bureau of Land Management Field Office in Grand Junction for allowing us to operate our rover on their land. Sandshark is dedicated to the memory of Dan Zahner. Dan was a wonderful mentor and an inspiration to us all; he will be dearly missed.</p>

<p>Sandshark uses the 4G cell network to communicate with human operators, who can view camera streams and send commands via a web interface. It recharges its SLA battery with a 50W solar panel. Sandshark's frame is constructed from 1" square aluminum extrusion and sheet metal gussets. Each wheel uses a custom-machined shaft. It is equipped with two cameras, GPS, and temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors. A Raspberry Pi handles the connection to the cell network and provides video streams and an Arduino Mega controls the array of motors and sensors. Sandshark has several safety features: it will automatically stop all motors if the rover loses cell connection or a human operator disconnects. It has no autonomous features so a human is in the loop at all times.</p>
