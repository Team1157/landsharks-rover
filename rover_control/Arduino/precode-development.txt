needs start-of-packet sequence. header with message length

Commands:
	unified wheels move (specify movement for each wheel)
	unified travel (specify overall travel)
	individual wheel move
	poll wheel data
	heartbeat
	potential sensor commands?
	set PID values
	read PID values
	E-stop
	camera servos control

format (each is a byte):
	command (length based on command ID)

	Estop          : 0x00
	Heartbeat      : 0x01

movement calculation

D = .29m
VMax = 1.1m/s; //roughly - need empirical
VIn = getInput() * 1m/s;
VMmVI = VMax - VIn;
RefRad = (vin * d)/VMmVI;
Angle = VMmVI/d;
OuterTravel = (RefRad + d) * Angle;
InnerTravel = (RefRad - d) * Angle;

control loop

PID loop controlling driver power output as a function of motor velocity set by velocity. One per motor
PID loop controlling motor velocity (input to other PID) as a function of motor position set by a total travel distance. One per side
